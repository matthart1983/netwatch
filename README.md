# NetWatch

**Real-time network diagnostics in your terminal — like htop for your network.**

NetWatch is a lightweight, keyboard-driven TUI application that gives you instant visibility into network traffic, active connections, interface health, live packet capture with deep protocol inspection, network topology mapping, connection timelines, and AI-powered network insights. Built with Rust for speed and low overhead.

## Permissions

NetWatch works in two modes:

| Feature | Without `sudo` | With `sudo` |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Interface stats & rates | ✅ | ✅ |
| Active connections | ✅ | ✅ |
| Network configuration | ✅ | ✅ |
| Health probes (ICMP ping) | ❌ Shows N/A | ✅ |
| Packet capture | ❌ Permission denied | ✅ |
| AI insights (Ollama) | ✅ (if Ollama running) | ✅ (if Ollama running) |

The app degrades gracefully — features that require elevated privileges show a clear message rather than crashing.

### macOS BPF permissions

Packet capture on macOS requires access to `/dev/bpf*` devices, which are root-only by default. You have two options:

1. **Run with sudo** (recommended for occasional use):
   ```bash
   sudo ./target/release/netwatch
   ```

2. **Open BPF devices** (persistent, for frequent use):
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 644 /dev/bpf*
   ```
   > ⚠️ This allows any user to capture packets. Resets on reboot.

## How It Works

### Data Collection

| Collector | Interval | Source (macOS) | Source (Linux) |
|-----------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Interface stats | 1s | `netstat -ib` | `/sys/class/net/*/statistics` |
| Interface info | 10s | `ifconfig` | `/sys/class/net/*` + `ip addr` |
| Connections | 2s | `lsof -i -n -P` | `/proc/net/tcp` + `/proc/*/fd` |
| Config | 10s | `netstat -rn`, `scutil --dns` | `ip route`, `/etc/resolv.conf` |
| Health | 5s | `ping -c 3 -t 1` | `ping -c 3 -W 1` |
| Packets | Real-time | libpcap (BPF) | libpcap |
| GeoIP | On-demand | ip-api.com (HTTP) | ip-api.com (HTTP) |
| Whois | On-demand | rdap.org (HTTPS) | rdap.org (HTTPS) |

### Packet Decoding Pipeline

```
Raw bytes → Ethernet → IPv4/IPv6/ARP → TCP/UDP/ICMP → DNS/TLS/HTTP/DHCP/NTP
                                            ↓
                              Stream tracking (per 4-tuple)
                              TCP handshake timing (SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK)
                              Expert info classification
                              Payload text extraction
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `Permission denied` on packet capture | Run with `sudo` |
| `BIOCPROMISC: operation not supported` | Interface doesn't support promiscuous mode — NetWatch falls back automatically |
| Health shows `N/A` | ICMP ping requires root — run with `sudo` |
| No connections listed | `lsof` (macOS) or `/proc` (Linux) access may be restricted |
| Binary not found after build | Check `./target/release/netwatch` exists |
| Blank screen | Ensure terminal supports 256 colors and is at least 80×24 |
| GeoIP/Whois not loading | Requires internet access; results appear after a short delay |
| AI insights shows "Ollama unavailable" | Install and start Ollama: `ollama serve`, then `ollama pull llama3.2` |
| AI analysis is slow | Ollama runs locally — performance depends on your hardware. Consider a smaller model |
